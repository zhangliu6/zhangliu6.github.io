## Projects & Publications

* **(current project) Persistent Homology of Semantic Spaces**

  Details: This is a research module on the topic of Topological Data Analysis (TDA). The aim of the project is to investigate the effectiveness of applying methods in the emerging feld of TDA to solve problems that involve natural language data. We will study the state-of-the-art method of persistent homology and several notable applications in computational analysis of natural language. In particular, we hope to investigate how effective the topological approach is compared to the traditional regression-based tools and why, which is still an open problem (Savle et al., 2019). In this project, we study the mathematical foundations of the state-of-the-art methods in topological data analysis as well as the existing semantic space models. Further, we aim to investigate the effectiveness of these methods as well as to propose and possibly implement some improvements.
  
  Topics to be studied include: point-set topology, algebraic topology, persistence, homology, simplicial complex, the persistence algorithms, semantic space models.

* **Numerical Exponential Polynomials**

This project focused on the relative growth of terms in exponential polynomials. In different regions of the complex plane, dierent terms of an exponential polynomial dominate others. I used analytic and geometric arguments to compare the relative dominance of terms.

For research outputs, please refer to my [report](https://github.com/zhangliu6/pdfs/blob/master/rank-terms-liu.pdf) and [expository notes on Complex Analysis](https://github.com/zhangliu6/pdfs/blob/master/notes-on-complex-analysis-liu.pdf).

* **Hybrid Analytical-Numerical Integration**

This project focused on Julia library for exponential sums and survey of Langer's work. I implemented a Julia library providing for the efficient description and algebra of exponential sums. Exponential sums are exponential polynomials in which each polynomial coecient is a complex constant. I also surveyed Langer's (1931) paper on the asymptotic locus of zeros of such functions.

For research outputs, please refer to my [report](https://www.unifiedtransformlab.com/outputs.html#Zha2019a) and [code](https://www.unifiedtransformlab.com/outputs.html#Zha2019b).

* **Digital Gazetteer Project at Yale Digital Humanities Lab**

In this project worked with my colleagues at the Yale Digital Humanities Lab on the Digital Gazetteer Project. I built the geocoding database for the project and acquired skills in essential tools in Digital Humanities, including text mining and processing, ArcGIS, Augmented Reality using Unity game engine, user design principles. I also attended weekly meetings and various workshops organized by the Yale Digital Humanities Lab and the Yale Library.
